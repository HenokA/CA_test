# CATest
## The History for Tomorrow

CATest is a website that pulls information from the STAR Test Results page of the California Department of Education. Here, any public user can access information on on the CST, one of California's major standardized tests.

CATest then visualizes the immense amount of information found on the STAR Test Results website so that everyone can gain a better understanding of where each grade stands in its standardized test scores.

CATest was made in the hopes of making it easier to target areas which need extra attention and to monitor the progress of students throughout the San Francisco area, and hopefully all of California.
